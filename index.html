					<aside class="notes">
						Javascript today is a very quickly evolving language but this wasn't
						always the case.  The ecmascript language has come a long way
						and part of that has been the need to adapt to current browser development
						speed.   I'm going to take you through where it started and how we
						got to the new  proposal process using the example of the recently accepted
						feature, the exponentiation operator.  I'm calling this, a

							Anyway, after years of working on ES6 they decided that they need to change
